def fast_gelu(x):
    r"""
    Fast Gaussian Error Linear Units activation function.

    FastGeLU is defined as follows:

    .. math::
        \text{output} = \frac {x} {1 + \exp(-1.702 * \left| x \right|)} * \exp(0.851 * (x - \left| x \right|)),

    where :math:`x` is the element of the input.

    Args:
        x (Tensor): Input to compute the FastGeLU with data type of float16 or float32.

    Returns:
        Tensor, with the same type and shape as `x`.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If dtype of `x` is neither float16 nor float32.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``CPU``

    Examples:
        >>> x = Tensor(np.array([[-1.0, 4.0, -8.0], [2.0, -5.0, 9.0]]), mindspore.float32)
        >>> output = ops.fast_gelu(x)
